# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Dawson (he/him), and most enjoy action games, rpgs, and platformers. Some of my favorite games are the Armored Core Series (For Answer and VI), Souls, Hades, Hollow Knight and Blasphemous. I'm taking this class because I want to improve my skills in Unity and C#, particularly in regards to physics, coding 3D games and UI elements. I have prior experience in Unity, C# and other programming languages.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
   
3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

Become more confident in the Unity editor and C#, so that I can make more complex and diverse games in Unity. I am also looking forward to more experience in collaboration when making games.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
	C#, Java, C++, C, Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL 

2. Game development (any engine)
	Unity

3. Unity
	Experience creating simple 2D games (platformers, adventure games) and a very basic amount of 3D physics. 

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
	n/a

2. Scope management
	Managing the complexity and scale of a game. 

3. Iteration
	The process of traversing through a data set with the purpose of altering or accessing the data using a loop or other means.
